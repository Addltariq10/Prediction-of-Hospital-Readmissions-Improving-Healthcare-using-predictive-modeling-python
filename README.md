# Prediction-of-Hospital-Readmissions-Improving-Healthcare-using-predictive-modeling-python

### Problem:
Investigate the problem of predicting readmission of hospital patients. Readmission of patients following discharge from the hospital places an enormous and very expensive burden on the US healthcare system (estimated at $40B in 2011).

### Objective:
The objective of predictive analysis is to build a binary classification model that can predict early (<30 days) readmission given the patientâ€™s features.


### Dataset Summary:
The dataset (diabetic_data.csv) represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. Information was extracted from the database for encounters that satisfied the following criteria. 
1. It is an inpatient encounter (a hospital admission). 
2.  It is a diabetic encounter, that is, one during which any kind of diabetes was entered into the system as a diagnosis. 
3. The length of stay was at least 1 day and at most 14 days. 
4. Laboratory tests were performed during the encounter.
5. Medications were administered during the encounter. The data contains such attributes as patient number, race, gender, age, admission type, time in hospital, medical specialty of admitting physician, number of lab tests performed, HbA1c test result, diagnosis, number of medications, diabetic medications, number of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits in the year before the hospitalization, etc. Some of these are encoded as numeric codes whose meanings are described in a separate file (IDs_mapping.csv) that is part of the download.
